Convolutional networks(LeCun, 1989), also known as convolutional neural
networks, or CNNs, are a specialized kind of neural network for processing data
that has a known grid-like topology. Examples include time-series data, which can
be thought of as a 1-D grid taking samples at regular time intervals, and image data,
which can be thought of as a 2-D grid of pixels. Convolutional networks have been
tremendously successful in practical applications. The name “convolutional neural
network” indicates that the network employs a mathematical operation called
convolution. Convolution is a specialized kind of linear operation. Convolutional
networks are simply neural networks that use convolution in place of general matrix
multiplication in at least one of their layers.

In this chapter, we ﬁrst describe what convolution is. Next, we explain the
motivation behind using convolution in a neural network. We then describe an
operation called pooling, which almost all convolutional networks employ. Usually,
the operation used in a convolutional neural network does not correspond precisely
to the deﬁnition of convolution as used in other ﬁelds, such as engineering or
pure mathematics. We describe several variants on the convolution function that
are widely used in practice for neural networks. We also show how convolution
may be applied to many kinds of data, with diﬀerent numbers of dimensions. We
then discuss means of making convolution more eﬃcient. Convolutional networks
stand out as an example of neuroscientiﬁc principles inﬂuencing deep learning.
We discuss these neuroscientiﬁc principles, then conclude with comments about
the role convolutional networks have played in the history of deep learning. One
topic this chapter does not address is how to choose the architecture of your
convolutional network. The goal of this chapter is to describe the kinds of tools
that convolutional networks provide, while chapter 11 describes general guidelines
for choosing which tools to use in which circumstances. Research into convolutional
network architectures proceeds so rapidly that a new best architecture for a given
benchmark is announced every few weeks to months, rendering it impractical to
describe in print the best architecture. Nonetheless, the best architectures have
consistently been composed of the building blocks described here.
